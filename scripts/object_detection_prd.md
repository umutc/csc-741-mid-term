# Overview

This project, developed as a midterm assignment for CSC 741 (Digital Image Processing), addresses the problem of automatically identifying potential skin cancer lesions in dermoscopic images. Leveraging fundamental image processing techniques described in the course lecture PDFs **and specific feature sets presented in related materials**, the product aims to assist in the initial exploration and analysis of skin lesions by providing a tool for segmentation and **advanced feature extraction**. It's for students and researchers interested in applying core IP concepts to a real-world medical imaging challenge. The value lies in demonstrating the practical application of learned techniques to a relevant domain and highlighting the potential of **specific, mathematically defined image features** for diagnostic tasks, serving as a foundational step for more advanced systems.

# Core Features

This project implements a pipeline with the following core features:

*   **Image Loading and Pre-processing:**
    *   **What it does:** Loads dermoscopic images from the specified dataset and performs initial transformations necessary for subsequent processing steps.
    *   **Why it's important:** Provides the input data in a usable format and converts it to appropriate color spaces (grayscale, HSV, RGB) required for different analysis techniques, ensuring data compatibility.
    *   **How it works at a high level:** Reads image files (e.g., JPEG) and applies color space conversions (RGB to Grayscale, RGB to HSV) using standard image processing libraries in Python. **Also calculates a custom Darkness (Ida) channel.**

*   **Lesion Segmentation:**
    *   **What it does:** Identifies and isolates the area of the skin lesion from the surrounding healthy skin, generating a binary mask.
    *   **Why it's important:** Defining the precise region of interest (the lesion) is essential before extracting features specific to that area, separating the object from the background.
    *   **How it works at a high level:** Applies thresholding techniques (primarily Otsu's method based on implementation) to the grayscale image to classify pixels as either belonging to the lesion or the background based on intensity characteristics, as covered in the course lectures.

*   **Segmentation Mask Refinement:**
    *   **What it does:** Cleans and improves the binary mask obtained from the initial segmentation step.
    *   **Why it's important:** Segmentation often results in noisy or imperfect masks (e.g., including hair, small artifacts, or holes within the lesion). Refinement produces a cleaner and more accurate representation of the lesion's shape.
    *   **How it works at a high level:** Utilizes morphological operations like Opening (erosion followed by dilation) to remove small unwanted objects and Closing (dilation followed by erosion) to fill small holes and smooth boundaries of the segmented region, using defined structuring elements.

*   **Feature Extraction:**
    *   **What it does:** Computes a specific set of **Brightness, Saturation, and Darkness features (f1-f28)** from the refined segmented lesion area, based on provided formulas.
    *   **Why it's important:** These mathematically defined features aim to quantify visual characteristics of the lesion (related to brightness, color purity/saturation, and darkness/contrast) that may be relevant to diagnostic processes.
    *   **How it works at a high level:** Calculates histograms and statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis - as implied by f1-f4, f10-f13, f19-f22) from pixel values within the lesion mask for the **Brightness (HSV Value channel), Saturation (HSV Saturation channel), and Darkness (Ida = max(R,G,B) - min(R,G,B) channel)**. Also calculates other specified features involving entropy, adjacent histogram bin differences, and range-based ratios (f5-f9, f14-f18, f23-f28).

*   **Output Visualization:**
    *   **What it does:** Presents the results of the detection and feature extraction process in a clear, viewable format.
    *   **Why it's important:** Allows the user to visually verify the accuracy of the segmentation and inspect the extracted features (**including the newly implemented f1-f28 features**) associated with each detected lesion.
    *   **How it works at a high level:** Displays the original image alongside the segmented lesion mask (e.g., as an overlay or separate binary image). Prints or displays the numerical feature values (including f1-f28) calculated for the detected lesion.

# User Experience

*   **User Personas:**
    *   **The IP Student/Researcher:** Interested in applying and testing fundamental digital image processing concepts on a practical problem. Their primary goal is to successfully implement the pipeline using course techniques and analyze the results technically.
*   **Key User Flows:**
    1.  Select input images from the dataset.
    2.  Run the Python script.
    3.  View the output, including the original image, the segmented lesion mask, and the extracted feature values for the detected lesion.
    4.  Manually assess the quality of the segmentation.
    5.  Analyze the presented feature values, potentially comparing them across images with different benign/malignant labels.
*   **UI/UX Considerations:** The primary interface is the command line for running the script and displaying basic output. Visual output (images) will be displayed in separate windows using a plotting/image display library. Clarity of output (e.g., clearly labeled feature values, distinct visual highlighting of the lesion) is the main UI/UX focus within this scope.

# Technical Architecture

*   **System Components:**
    *   **Python Script:** The main application logic will reside in a single or a few interconnected Python files.
    *   **Image Loading Library:** Utilizing a library like OpenCV (`cv2`) or Pillow (`PIL`) for reading and manipulating image data.
    *   **Numerical Computation Library:** Using NumPy for efficient array operations and mathematical calculations required for image processing and feature extraction.
    *   **Scientific/Signal Processing Libraries:** Potentially using SciPy for morphological operations if not fully covered or efficiently available in OpenCV/NumPy, or for basic statistical calculations (though NumPy covers many).
    *   **Plotting Library (Optional but Recommended for Evaluation):** Matplotlib can be used for displaying images and potentially visualizing feature distributions during evaluation.
    *   **Dataset Files:** Accessing image files (JPEG) and the `train.csv` metadata file from the Kaggle dataset directory structure.

# Logical Dependency Chain

1.  **Data Loading and Pre-processing:** Must be implemented first to get data into a usable format (Grayscale, HSV, **RGB for Ida**). **Includes Ida channel calculation.**
2.  **Lesion Segmentation (Thresholding):** Depends on having a grayscale image. Provides the initial mask.
3.  **Segmentation Mask Refinement (Morphological Operations):** Depends on having a binary mask from segmentation. Improves the quality of the mask.
4.  **Feature Extraction (f1-f28):** Depends on having the **HSV image (for V and S channels), the Ida channel image**, and the *refined* binary mask to define the area of interest. Requires histogram calculation for V, S, and Ida channels within the mask.
    *   Brightness Features (f1-f9) depend on V channel histogram.
    *   Saturation Features (f10-f18) depend on S channel histogram.
    *   Darkness Features (f19-f28) depend on Ida channel histogram.
5.  **Output Visualization:** Depends on having the original image, the (refined) binary mask, and the extracted feature values (**including f1-f28**) ready to display.
6.  **Evaluation Analysis:** Depends on having extracted **features f1-f28** for multiple images and access to the ground truth labels from the CSV.

# Risks and Mitigations

*   **Technical Challenge: Difficulty in achieving accurate segmentation with basic techniques:**
    *   *Risk:* Simple thresholding methods might struggle with variations in skin tone, lighting, hair, or other artifacts common in dermoscopic images, leading to poor lesion isolation.
    *   *Mitigation:* Explore and compare different thresholding approaches covered in the PDFs (Global, Histogram-based, Adaptive). Experiment with different structuring element sizes and types for morphological refinement. Acknowledge limitations in the report if perfect segmentation is not achievable with these basic methods.
*   **Technical Challenge: Complexities in extracting specific PDF features:**
    *   *Risk:* Translating the high-level descriptions **or mathematical formulas (f1-f28)** of some features or operations **from the reference material** into precise, numerically stable code implementation might be challenging (e.g., handling edge cases like zero variance, interpreting entropy definitions, calculating higher-order moments accurately).
    *   *Mitigation:* Break down complex formulas into smaller steps. Use established library functions (e.g., `scipy.stats` for skewness, kurtosis, entropy if applicable) where possible. Verify intermediate calculations. Document any assumptions made or difficulties encountered. Focus on implementing a core subset if time is limited.
*   **Figuring out the MVP:**
    *   *Risk:* Getting stuck on complex segmentation or feature extraction early on.
    *   *Mitigation:* Prioritize Phase 1 and early parts of Phase 2 to quickly get a basic visual pipeline working (load -> grayscale -> simple threshold -> show mask) before adding refinement and features.
*   **Resource Constraints (Time/Dataset Size):**
    *   *Risk:* The full dataset is too large to process within the midterm timeframe, or implementing all desired features becomes too time-consuming.
    *   *Mitigation:* Select a smaller, representative subset of the dataset (e.g., 50-100 images, ensuring a mix of benign and malignant cases if possible) for development and testing. Prioritize features that seem most promising based on medical knowledge and PDF techniques. Clearly define the scope of features implemented in the final report.
*   **Lack of Detailed Ground Truth Masks:**
    *   *Risk:* The Kaggle dataset primarily provides image-level labels, not precise pixel-level segmentation masks for evaluation.
    *   *Mitigation:* Focus the segmentation evaluation on visual inspection and qualitative assessment as planned. Emphasize the analysis of feature distinctiveness using the image-level labels, as this is a key output of the feature extraction process. Acknowledge the limitation in performing pixel-perfect quantitative segmentation evaluation without detailed masks.
